# Jester  
Jester is a gesture recognition system and web-app that allows users to control their device's camera using hand gestures. 

The system uses a loosely coupled client server architecture based on a gesture recogition API which is written primarily in python, and a web-app built with Vue.js. Both the client and server code has continuously been tested by an extensive suite of unit, integration, and system tests, ensuring high quality software. 

The installer makes setting the API up to run on a server very easy, and the app can be configured to connect to any instance of the API simply by typing in the server's address.
